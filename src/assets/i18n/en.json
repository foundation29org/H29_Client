    "What is the genome":"What is the genome?",
    "Answer genome":"A genome is the complete set of information that is needed to build and maintain a single individual, like a big instruction book. The human genome is split into 23 sections of information known as chromosomes, which can be thought of as chapters in a book. The human genome is made of DNA.",
    "What is DNA":"What is DNA?",
    "Answer DNA":"DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is a long molecule that contains our unique genetic code. Like a recipe book it holds the instructions for making all the proteins in our bodies. The human genome is made of 3.2 billion bases of DNA but other organisms have different genome sizes",
    "What are genes":"What are genes?",
    "Answer genes":"Our bodies are made up of millions of cells. Most of those cells contain a complete set of genes. Genes act like a set of instructions, controlling our growth and how our bodies work. They are also responsible for many of our characteristics, such as our eye colour, blood type and height. We have thousands of genes. We each inherit two copies of most genes, one copy from our mother and one copy from our father. That is why we often have similar characteristics to both of them.",
    "What are chromosomes":"What are chromosomes? ",
    "Answer chromosomes":"Genes are located on small thread-like structures called chromosomes. Usually we have 46 chromosomes or two sets of 22 autosomes in most cells and one pair of sex chromosomes. We inherit one set of 22 autosomes from our mother and one set of 22 autosomes from our father and inherit one pair of sex chromosomes. The 23rd set, the sex chromosomes differ between males (XY) and females (XX).",
    "What is a genetic variant":"What is a genetic variant? ",
    "Answer genetic variant":"A genetic variant is a difference in a person’s genetic material (DNA) that affects one or more of their genes or chromosomes. Each and every one of us has some genetic variants, whether or not they have a condition. Some genetic variants don’t have any negative impact on the health of a person, but sometimes they can be the cause of a genetic condition.",
    "What is a mutation":"What is a mutation? ",
    "Answer mutation":"Sometimes, there is a change (mutation) in one copy of a gene or chromosome which stops it from working properly. This change can cause a genetic condition because the gene is not communicating the correct instructions to the body. Some examples of genetic conditions include Down’s syndrome, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. ",
    "What is a genetic test":"What is a genetic test? ",
    "Answer genetic test":"A genetic test can help identify if there is a change in a particular gene or chromosome. It is usually a blood (sometimes a tissue) test. There are a number of reasons why a person might take a genetic test.",

We recommend patients to have access to their own genome or exome. This information can be obtained from the lab who did the genetic analysis. You as patient have right to have this information.
